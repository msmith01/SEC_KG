## Python Pipeline

### Preprocessing

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| P-1 | `preprocessing/cleaner.py` — HTML/XBRL strip, whitespace | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| P-2 | `preprocessing/segmenter.py` — spaCy sentence segmentation | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | `max_length=3_000_000` set to handle large filings |
| P-3 | `preprocessing/tagger.py` — forward-looking + coreference tags | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| P-4 | `preprocessing/pipeline.py` — R `.txt` → `SectionDocument` JSON | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | Walks year subdirs; parses CIK/ticker/date header |
| P-5 | Fix spaCy `max_length` crash on large filings | ✅ | 2026-02-21 | 2026-02-21 | Some paragraphs exceed 1M chars; raised limit to 3M |
| P-6 | Preprocess all currently collected files | 🔄 | 2026-02-20 | — | ~17,858 RF / 18,745 business / 18,997 MDA preprocessed (55,600 total as of 2026-02-24); cron keeping pace |
| P-7 | Continuous preprocessing of new files (cron) | 🔄 | 2026-02-20 | — | Hourly cron; runs automatically as collection adds files |

### Glossary

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| G-1 | `glossary/extractor.py` — rule-based + LLM term extraction | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| G-2 | `glossary/vector_store.py` — ChromaDB integration | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| G-3 | Initial glossary build (58 terms, 8 companies) | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| G-4 | Glossary rebuild from ~3,748 docs (rules-only) | ✅ | 2026-02-20 | 2026-02-21 | 65 KB glossary; stale — full corpus rebuild needed |
| G-5 | **Glossary rebuild from full corpus** | 📋 | — | — | Run after collection + preprocessing settles: `python3 python/run_glossary.py --rules-only --index-chroma` |
| G-6 | LLM-mode glossary extraction at scale | ⚠️ | — | — | Blocked on GPU stability; code exists in `extractor.py` |

### Ontology & KG Population

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| O-1 | `ontology/nodes.py` — 18 typed node classes | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | Company, Filing, Section, RiskFactor, RiskDriver, Competitor, Product, etc. |
| O-2 | `ontology/relations.py` — 25 relation types | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | |
| O-3 | `ontology/neo4j_schema.py` — constraints + indexes | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | 19 uniqueness constraints + 8 indexes applied |
| O-4 | `FiscalYear` anchor nodes + `PRECEDES` chain | ✅ | 2026-02-20 | 2026-02-20 | Multi-year graph scaffold; `FILED_IN` edges per filing |
| O-5 | `kg_population/extractor.py` — LLM entity/relation extractor | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | Section-tailored prompts; unreliable due to GPU crashes |
| O-6 | `kg_population/ner_extractor.py` — spaCy fast extractor | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | No GPU needed; some NER noise (ORG false positives) |
| O-7 | Checkpoint system (`.checkpoint.json`) | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | Per-document; restarts skip already-done sections |
| O-8 | Ollama retry / `keep_alive=-1` fix | ✅ | 2026-02-19 | 2026-02-19 | Exponential backoff; prevents VRAM eviction |
| O-9 | **KG population (fast/spaCy) — full corpus** | 🔄 | 2026-02-24 | — | Running throttled: `python3 run_kg_population.py --fast --delay 2` (PID 8839); log: `logs/kg_population_throttled.log`; ~3,961/55,600 checkpointed; ~8–23s/doc with delay; est. multi-day |
| O-10 | **LLM-mode KG re-population** | ⚠️ | — | — | Blocked on GPU; will replace spaCy NER noise with higher-quality entities |
| O-11 | **KG pipeline performance optimisation** | ✅ | 2026-02-24 | 2026-02-24 | 3-4x speedup: (1) `nlp.pipe(batch_size=64)` instead of per-sentence calls; (2) `write_document()` — single Neo4j session per doc; (3) edge `MERGE (a)-[r:TYPE]->(b)` without `filing_ref` in key — eliminates multigraph buildup; (4) checkpoint every 50 docs. Committed `2906cb5`. Graph wiped + restarted clean. |
| O-12 | **KG OOM crash fix — lazy document loading** | ✅ | 2026-02-24 | 2026-02-24 | Old code loaded all 55,600 JSON docs into RAM at startup (~40 GB → OOM kill after ~4h). Fixed: one doc loaded per iteration, previous doc GC'd. Fast section_id scan reads only first 100 bytes per file (8x faster). Committed `7ff22f5`. |
| O-13 | **KG throttle flag (`--delay`)** | ✅ | 2026-02-24 | 2026-02-24 | Added `--delay N` arg to `run_kg_population.py` — sleeps N seconds between docs; passes through to `pipeline.run_all()`. Current run uses `--delay 2`. |

## Graph Enrichment (Planned)

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| E-1 | **Cross-year semantic linking** | 📋 | — | — | `PERSISTED_TO`, `EMERGED_IN`, `RESOLVED_IN` edges between RiskFactor nodes across years; uses sentence embeddings to match |
| E-2 | **Cross-section linking** | 📋 | — | — | Link entities appearing in multiple sections of the same filing (Item 1 ↔ 1A ↔ 7) |
| E-3 | **Taxonomy layer** | 📋 | — | — | Hierarchical concept tree between Glossary and Ontology (e.g. Market Risk → Interest Rate Risk → Fixed Rate Exposure) |
| E-4 | **Graph quality audit / NER noise cleanup** | 📋 | — | — | Cypher queries to flag false-positive Competitor/ORG nodes from spaCy; dedup pass |

---

## Analytics (Planned)

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| A-1 | **Risk co-occurrence network** | 📋 | — | — | Edges between RiskDriver nodes that frequently appear together across filings |
| A-2 | **Sector risk profiles** | 📋 | — | — | Cluster risk types by SIC code; find sector-wide vs company-specific risks |
| A-3 | **Temporal trend analysis** | 📋 | — | — | Track rising/falling frequency of risk types year-over-year (e.g. "AI risk" post-2022) |
| A-4 | **Competitor network** | 📋 | — | — | Derive a market competition graph from all Competitor nodes across filings |

---

## Product / Query Layer (Planned)

| # | Task | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Q-1 | **RAG query interface** | 📋 | — | — | Natural language → Cypher + ChromaDB hybrid retrieval; FastAPI or Streamlit |
| Q-2 | **Semantic search CLI/API** | 📋 | — | — | ChromaDB populated but no user-facing query layer |
| Q-3 | **Analyst dashboard** | 📋 | — | — | Simple web UI over search + graph queries without writing Cypher |

## Suggested Build Order

```
[NOW — RUNNING OVERNIGHT]
  O-9  → KG population --fast --delay 2 (PID 8839; check logs/kg_population_throttled.log)
         Monitor: tail -f logs/kg_population_throttled.log
         Progress: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('python/data/kg_export/.checkpoint.json')); print(len(d), '/ ~55600')"
         Neo4j: docker start neo4j-sec (if it isn't running)

[TOMORROW — first things]
  1. Restart R collection (stopped overnight):
       bash run_parallel_collection.sh 2023 4
       bash run_parallel_collection.sh 2024 4
  2. Start glossary rebuild (failed to launch last session — log was 0 bytes):
       python3 python/run_glossary.py --rules-only --index-chroma > logs/glossary_rebuild.log 2>&1 &
  3. Check KG checkpoint progress and adjust --delay if CPU still high

[While O-9 runs]
  G-5  → rebuild glossary from full corpus (can run in parallel — lightweight, CPU-only)
         python3 python/run_glossary.py --rules-only --index-chroma

[After 2023/2024 collection + O-9 completes]
  R-10 → start 1993-2014 historical collection
         bash run_smart_collection.sh 1993 2014 4 6

[After full corpus in graph]
  E-4  → graph quality audit / NER noise cleanup  ← lots of false-positive Competitor nodes
  E-1  → cross-year semantic linking  ← biggest graph value-add
  E-2  → cross-section linking

[After enrichment]
  A-1  → risk co-occurrence
  A-3  → temporal trends

[Product layer]
  Q-1  → RAG query interface
  Q-3  → analyst dashboard
```
